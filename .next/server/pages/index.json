I am based out of sunny ‚òÄÔ∏è Edinburgh, Scotland and currently doing freelance work and consulting for international clients.</p>\n<p>I started creating cool web designs using HTML and CSS back in 2006. I am JavaScript enthusiast and extremely passionate about coding. I love to learn new things every day and keep up with the new technologies. In many ways, websites and apps are my first love. üß°</p>\n<p>Last but not least, one of my favorite actuvutes is to educate and mentor others in the field to fulfill their potential and deepen my knowledge.

Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.</p>\n<p>In that case, you can use <strong>Server-Side Rendering</strong>. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.</p>\n","title":"When to Use Static Generation v.s.

The difference is in <strong>when</strong> it generates the HTML for a page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Static Generation</strong> is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at <strong>build time</strong>. The pre-rendered HTML is then <em>reused</em> on each request.</li>\n<li><strong>Server-side Rendering</strong> is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on <strong>each request</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, Next.js lets you <strong>choose</strong> which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.</p>\n","title":"Two Forms of Pre-rendering","date":"2020-01-01"}],"services":[{"icon":"code","title":"Web Development","text":"HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), JavaScript(MERN Stack), Gatsby, and Firebase.
